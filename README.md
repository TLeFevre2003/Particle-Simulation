# Overview


For this software I wanted to attempt making a realistic simulation of particles. I also was interested in learning lua so I figured 
I could do both of that in this project.

In this program it simulates the movement and collision of particles with realistic physics. You can add particles by clicking on the screen with the mouse or hitting the t key to toggle shooting fast particles from the top left. 

I had 2 goals in this project, one was to learn Lua, the other was to create an accurate simulation. I chose a particle simulation because they are always interesting to watch and they are interactive so you can affect them with your input.

# Development Environment


The tools I used to develop this software were vs code, lua extention, lua debug extension, and Love2D support extension. I also used Git for version control and Github for a remote repository.

The language I used in this program were the lua programming language, and I also used a lua game engine called LÃ–VE.

# Future Work

- Develop a more efficient collision detection system using either quadtrees or a custom made grid based data structure.
- Research more on the physics of collisions between circles and air resistence along with friction to make the simulator more accurate.
- Add new features such as different colored circles and new ways to generate them such as randomly dropping them in sometimes.
- Add new environments other than a basic box.
- When all work with circles and more efficient collision is done add support for other shapes.
